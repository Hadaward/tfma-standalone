# Transformice Adventures Standalone
Transformice Adventures Standalone (TAS) is a program developed in NodeJS in support of the ElectronJS and Request libraries. It allows you to play on the desktop and also temporarily fixes the current problem with the game chat not working.

# Changelog

- I decided to polish some of the dirt, the Standalone code was redesigned to better meet my needs without compromising its performance.
- New options have been introduced to the Standalone menu, you may like to welcome **Cache** and **Debug** which allow you to clear the Standalone cache and enter Debug Mode allowing you to use unreleased features such as the reaction roulette (press F to open).
- Now to make sure your game is loading whenever the game starts to load any file, a loading message should appear in the menu, if it's taking too long to open the game after loading the files press CTRL + R and your game will be reloaded properly .
